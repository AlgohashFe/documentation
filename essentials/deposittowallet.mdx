3. üåê **Choose Network**: Below the QR code, you can select which blockchain network you want to use for the deposit. SpiderCard supports multiple networks, including Tron (TRC20), Ethereum (ERC20), and Solana (SOL). Make sure to select a network that matches the external wallet or exchange you're sending funds from.
4. üî¢ **Get Deposit Address**: After selecting a network (e.g., Tron network), the system will display the corresponding deposit address (in both QR code and text format). Click the **"Copy"** button below the address to copy it to your clipboard.

<Warning>
**Important Notes:**
* Make sure the network you choose **exactly matches** the network you're using to send funds. Sending funds to an incorrect network address may result in **permanent loss**.
* Each network has its own deposit address. Please carefully verify the address you've copied.
* Paste the copied address into the withdrawal page of the wallet or exchange you're transferring funds from.
* Deposits typically require some network confirmation time, please be patient.
</Warning>

<Tip>It's recommended to first make a small test transfer to ensure everything works correctly before making larger deposits.</Tip>
